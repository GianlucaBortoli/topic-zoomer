4,37,member."
43,59,"Do you suppose, if you had been a poor devil of a clerk, instead of
53,34,a millionaire's son, you would have been voted in?" asked Ainsley, a
36,13,trifle bitterly, a hard light flashing into his eyes.
29,20,"Possibly not," replied Ravenswood, with a good-humored laugh.
14,47,"I should have thought you would have improved the opportunity of
73,11,seeing considerable of the Three Graces awheel," said Ainsley, after a
76,30,few moments' pause.
94,98,"Their fathers discourage anything of that kind," laughed Philip; "as
79,21,more than one young man has found out."
98,46,"But iss ay's relatives--do none of them ride?"
14,48,"They are too old for that sort of thing," laughed Ravenswood. "The old
58,39,gentleman is as deaf as a post, and is relegated to the hotel piazza
69,24,because of the gout. His wife is equally as deaf, and is too unwieldly
83,39,to venture far from her corner of the piazza. It is laughable to hear
13,36,them shout at each other through their ear-trumpets. I have often
34,85,thought what a lonely life of it that beautiful young girl must have
18,94,with those two old people. It would be unendurable, I fancy, if it were
36,95,not for her two young friends."
89,30,"Probably they make up for not being companionable by not being so
74,20,strict with their pretty prospective little heiress?" suggested
28,35,Ainsley, again listening eagerly for his friend's reply.
100,80,"They certainly allow their granddaughter, or niece, whichever she is,
90,32,more liberty than Hildegarde's or Lily Ryder's parents do. Still, I
80,37,suppose they are confident that she can come to no harm, surrounded by
60,27,such careful friends and companions."
45,90,"Did you say, Philip, you were going to the fancy-dress masquerade
75,87,tournament?" asked Royal Ainsley, slowly.
34,50,"I do not propose to miss it," responded Ravenswood.
34,8,"Do you think you can secure me a ticket, Phil?" asked Ainsley,
26,40,point-blank. "Grant me that favor if you can. Remember, I ask it _as a
88,19,great favor_. Surely you can manage it somehow for me."
60,94,"I'll try," replied Ravenswood. "If it's possible, you shall attend."
30,73,During the next few days that followed, handsome Royal Ainsley saw as
38,15,much of the Three Graces as was possible. One day he was content with
55,3,a bow or a smile--on the next, a few words in passing; but he was wise
29,84,enough to keep out of the way whenever their relatives were about.
3,52,CHAPTER III.
87,92,The fancy-dress masquerade cycle carnival had been the talk of
18,59,fashionable circles in Newport for the last fortnight, and now, as the
6,26,auspicious evening drew near, excitement was almost at fever heat.
43,88,The tickets of admission had been closely guarded; gold could not buy
26,34,them. The tickets, which were strictly _not transferable_, had been
23,41,duly delivered by messengers to the different members whose names they
34,84,bore, and the promoters of the affair felt duly satisfied that no one
35,69,outside the charmed circle of Newport's fashionable Four Hundred could
53,20,by any possibility invade the sacred precincts.
56,6,A whole army of officers were to guard against intruders. There was
80,65,to be a banquet in the supper-room at midnight, after the masks of
67,15,the merry cyclers had been removed, that would be so startling in its
95,70,sumptuousness that the whole country would be talking about it, and
4,64,those who had been fortunate enough to attend would never forget it in
36,14,their after lives.
51,48,Philip Ravenswood had indeed done his utmost to secure the admittance
67,10,of his friend; but even he had failed signally. The officers were
44,8,inexorable in their polite but firm refusal to his request.
84,89,Two hours later the grand masquerade cycle carnival was at its height.
36,80,The marble walls of the millionaire club never held a more brilliant
23,96,gathering of ladies fair, with eyes behind silken masks brighter than
88,36,the diamonds they wore, and men braver than the famous knights of old
14,79,in their powdered wigs, satin knee-breeches and spangled waistcoats.
24,3,One wheelman, in the costume of handsome Romeo, sprung from his wheel
19,89,near one of the fountains, and watched with keen eyes through his mask
75,83,the cyclers as they passed him one after another.
17,7,"Aha! I have them at last," he muttered, as he noted three wood-nymphs
9,38,hovering close together. "Well, I declare, I thought I should have
11,60,little difficulty in distinguishing one from the other," he muttered;
50,69,"but to save my life, I can not tell them apart. I shall trust to fate
2,15,to choose for me, hoping it will be the beauteous Hildegarde."
46,57,Suddenly two plumed cavaliers sprung from their wheels before the two
46,52,foremost wood-nymphs, and asked permission in silent pantomime to ride
97,57,as their escorts around the rink, which request was graciously acceded
51,72,to, but with the dignity of young princesses.
28,76,"This is my opportunity," thought Romeo. "I must claim the remaining
52,88,wood-nymph before some other fellow has the chance to capture her."
48,55,The next instant he was bowing low before her.
40,87,"ay I have the great honor of riding as your escort around the rink,
44,13,fair wood-nymph?" he whispered in a low, melodious voice. "Ah, pardon
68,22,my speaking; it was purely a slip of the tongue. I should have made
57,89,known my request in pantomime. But pray forgive, and do not betray
77,59,me, fairest of all maidens, to the floor manager, pray, or I shall be
71,74,ordered from the floor in deep disgrace."
28,61,"If she answers, I shall know by her voice which one of the three
41,27,heiresses she is," he thought.
34,54,"Oh, I shall not betray you, r. Ainsley," replied the girl, with a
75,18,jolly little laugh, showing the whitest of pearly teeth, "and I accept
65,98,your escort to ride with me. I--I am so afraid of tumbling off my
78,70,wheel, this gay throng and the flashing lights bewilder me so. I--I was
35,6,just wondering if you would be here to-night."
56,14,"Fair maid, you know me?" he whispered, in apparent amazement. "I am
36,18,astounded, yet flattered. Pray be kind enough to exchange confidences.
40,32,I have been hoping against hope that _you_ are the one whom I longed to
66,77,see here. Surely the throbbings of my heart tell me who you are, fair
17,34,nymph. Shall I breathe to you the name of her whom I ardently wish it
45,82,to be?" he asked, softly.
3,93,"Yes," she answered, eagerly; and there was no mistaking the
67,29,characteristic catching of the breath, and the intense, eager gaze in
96,63,the velvety eyes behind the silken mask.
23,81,He crushed the furtive hope that had stirred his heart for an instant
12,0,that it might be Hildegarde, and answered, boldly:
21,28,"I prayed the fates to lead me to the feet of beauteous Ida ay! Oh,
83,17,tell me--am I right? Do be kind, and tell me."
30,82,"Then the fates have answered your prayer," she replied. "I suppose I
79,94,ought _not_ to tell you until unmasking time, but really I can not help
44,39,it. I _am_ Ida ay."
47,87,"Thanks, ten thousand thanks for ending my suspense, dear girl,"
66,78,he murmured, as only Royal Ainsley could utter the words. A few
87,37,sweeps around the rink, where handsome Romeo, with his superb fancy
34,42,riding, was the cynosure of all eager feminine eyes, midst murmurs
35,100,of admiration, then he whispered to his companion: "Come into the
80,33,conservatory; the air is too close here. You are riding as though you
43,19,were dizzy. Are you?"
20,59,"Yes," she answered. "I _must_ have air. I----"
89,77,The wheel suddenly wobbled recklessly from side to side, as though its
10,72,rider had lost control of it entirely.
64,95,Royal Ainsley sprung from his wheel just in time to prevent her from
12,61,falling, and in that instant he crushed her closely to his heart, then
79,3,as quickly released her.
91,93,The excitement was so great, no one noticed this little by-play, or
72,9,saw Romeo lead the fair wood-nymph from amid the glittering lights to
63,25,the shadowy depths of the cool conservatory. Standing their wheels
83,61,against a marble Flora, he found a rustic bench on which he placed
59,59,her, taking a seat beside her, dangerously near, his hand closing over
85,45,the fluttering little white one, his handsome head, with its fair,
95,69,clustering hair, bent near her own. A half hour they spent amid the
7,53,dim, cool shadows, the perfume of the roses enfolding them, the soft,
54,72,low, bewildering echo of the delicious music floating out to them.
62,37,Remember, the young girl was only seventeen, dear reader, otherwise the
78,80,place, and the scene, and the fair, handsome lover by her side could
80,34,not have infatuated her so quickly or so deeply.
2,88,"This is heaven!" he whispered. "How I wish we could linger here
50,27,forever, Ida--I your devoted knight, and you my queen, the world
51,61,forgetting, by the world forgot! Do _you_ wish it could be so?"
29,87,The low cadence of his voice; the thrilling touch of that strong, white
83,74,hand that was stealing around the supple waist, drawing her toward
52,6,him; the panting of his breath, which she could feel on her flushed
76,23,cheek; the mesmeric, steady gaze of those bright blue, shining eyes,
68,3,bewildered her--made her heart flutter as it had never fluttered
99,81,before.
59,43,"Do you wish we could be always together, Ida?" he persisted.
64,87,"Yes," answered the girl, with a half sob of affright, trembling under
52,50,the strange spell that had slowly but surely been cast over her.
44,89,"Then marry me, Ida!" he cried, "this very night--within the hour, and
58,85,no one can ever part us after that! Oh, Ida, do not refuse me!" he
67,55,urged. "I love you so that I would die for you. Fate surely intended us
22,32,for each other, or we would never have met and loved as we do. Oh, my
65,98,darling, you can not deny it! You do love me, Ida ay?"
53,29,She strove with all her might to deny it; but, in spite of herself,
25,62,he wrung the truth from her lips--that she _did_ love him. A sudden
2,46,light that she could not quite understand leaped up into his eyes for a
71,73,moment, and a triumphant smile curved his lips.
88,80,"We shall be married to-night, Ida!" he cried. "I will arrange it
87,80,somehow;" and as he uttered the words, he told himself that the great
42,47,heiress was as good as won.
4,60,CHAPTER IV.
83,7,The crash of the music, the hum of voices, and the song of the rippling
51,67,fountains seemed to dazzle Ida ay's senses.
36,43,"Promise me that you will marry me, my darling!" cried the impetuous
39,67,lover. "Would it be so very difficult, Ida?" he whispered.
0,47,She clung to him, the terror deepening in her eyes.
79,37,"This is a little romance all our own," he added, clasping her
58,4,closely. "Ida, let me kiss you!" He clasped his arms around her and
32,26,drew her to his breast. "You are mine in life, mine in death, and mine
32,49,through all eternity!"
2,13,He kissed the sweet lips over and over again.
63,94,She was so young that she believed him.
69,97,"Let us be married first, then we can talk over all these things
81,23,after!" he exclaimed, impetuously.
97,45,She was dazed by his passionate words.
17,38,He felt quite sure that this sweet, beautiful, dainty young girl could
72,66,not hold out against him if he only persisted.
87,85,One more bold stroke, and the heiress would be his.
24,83,There would be a scene, he well knew, when he brought the young girl
32,86,back to the old folks. But it would surely end by their forgiving her.
2,83,They could not hold out against her very long.
92,84,"You are--sure--it--it--would be right, r. Ainsley?" she faltered.
40,46,"You must not call me 'mister' sweet one," he cried. "To you I shall
57,38,be 'Royal' from now on to eternity. Let me manage this affair, my
27,56,darling," he added.
100,56,All power of resistance seemed swallowed up by his indomitable will.
72,62,"Go to the cloak-room, my love," he whispered, "and change your attire
74,8,as quickly as you can. I will meet you at the fountain nearest the
48,73,entrance. Not one word to either of your friends, Ida," he said,
21,96,warningly. "Promise me that!"
54,92,There was no crossing him. Indeed, the very power to even think for
4,84,herself seemed to have left her.
25,86,Like one in a dream, Ida ay donned her street clothes, the thought
17,16,filling her mind of what Hildegarde and Lily would say when it was
11,46,unmasking time and they came to look for her. How startled they would
9,16,be!
65,17,Outside all was confusion. There was a great crush of carriages, the
21,71,babble of coachmen and footmen, the crunching of wheels, and the
53,34,calling of numbers. To the girl whom Royal Ainsley led on to so strange
1,4,a fate it seemed like a dream. Some one followed with their wheels.
43,49,Royal Ainsley took them from the man, and she saw him toss him several
29,19,pieces of silver.
32,56,He did not tell her that he had written a note to an old minister,
80,3,living two miles out of the village, asking him to remain at home to
47,78,marry them. No name had been signed to the note; but he had argued to
84,44,himself that the minister, who probably was sadly in need of making an
37,22,extra dollar, would stay at home to perform the ceremony. If his plans
12,8,matured well, all well and good; if they miscarried, well, no one would
20,97,be the wiser as to who sent the letter.
70,45,He assisted her to mount her wheel, and, as if in a dream, they went
93,57,speeding down the boulevard.
69,80,"We must make quicker time, my darling," he said.
47,63,Was it a sob he heard coming from the girl's lips? Ida ay seemed to
48,95,have suddenly awakened to a sense of what she had done. A brief half
66,49,hour since she had been in the midst of a brilliant party, and now,
83,6,scarcely knowing how it had come about, she found herself flying with
69,7,the handsome lover, whom she had known but a few short weeks, going she
76,19,knew not whither.
33,37,The awakening came to her like a terrible shock.
90,62,"Royal!" she cried, "oh, Royal, what have we done? Where are we going?
28,75,I did not mean to run away. I must have been mad. Let us go back
15,90,again!"
38,100,As she spoke, the great clock from some adjoining tower struck the hour
16,65,of twelve.
58,61,"We are too late," he said. "We have burned our bridges behind us. They
98,74,are unmasking now, and they have missed you. They will soon institute a
19,86,search."
70,43,She clasped his arm.
43,78,"Oh, Royal! I must tell you all!"
33,80,The hot, trembling hand clung to him, the lovely young face was full of
34,88,awful grief.
97,60,"y own darling!" he cried, leaning over and rapturously embracing her,
52,94,though in doing so he nearly caused her to fall from her wheel.
84,98,Suddenly the heavens overhead seemed to darken, the wind to freshen,
72,34,and the booming of the waves, as they dashed heavily against the shore,
87,73,sounded dismally in the distance.
86,55,"We must make haste," said Royal Ainsley; "there is a storm coming up.
15,72,I think we could save nearly half a mile by cutting across this field."
52,63,He swung open a gate opening out into a broad patch of land, and Ida
80,78,rode in.
75,43,CHAPTER V.
48,20,"I see a light glimmering in a window a short distance away. I will
50,18,take you there, and walk back to the village to get some kind of a
62,87,conveyance."
22,46,In a few moments they found themselves knocking for admission at the
13,78,little cottage from whence they had observed the light.
87,40,His impatient knock brought a white, terrified face to a window which
40,36,was opened above.
31,21,"What do you want?" asked a voice in unmistakable tones of fear.
33,1,"I must have shelter for this young lady for a little while," exclaimed
88,10,Ainsley, impatiently; adding: "I will pay you handsomely if you will
85,36,allow her to remain here an hour or two, until I can go for a carriage
7,58,for her."
22,17,The window was closed quickly down again, and Royal heard some one say
20,46,quite distinctly:
86,79,"I tell you it is only a _ruse_. It is an officer of the law."
49,25,Again Royal knocked impatiently.
79,59,"It is commencing to rain," he called. "For Heaven's sake, open the
42,27,door quickly!"
12,23,Despite the sobs and protestations of the voice inside, a man opened
24,93,the door and stepped out, confronting them. One hand held a lighted
61,68,lamp and the other rested upon his hip pocket.
28,7,To Royal Ainsley's intense astonishment, he found that he was at the
25,92,summer cottage of Newport's haughty mayor.
95,5,"I beg your pardon," stammered the man, in dire confusion.
26,65,"It is rather late to awaken any one; but you have heard the words,
61,25,'any port in a storm'? The truth is, I want to find shelter for this
42,98,young lady until I can go for a conveyance to take her to a minister
8,39,who is awaiting us to perform the marriage ceremony."
8,1,"Oh, that is it!" exclaimed the mayor, with a look of relief coming
1,1,over his face. "An elopement, eh?"
3,0,"All is fair in love, you know," laughed the young man, leading Ida
67,10,into the parlor, his host preceding them.
62,1,"Who are you, and who is the young lady?" inquired the man.
19,86,It was Royal's turn to hesitate now. If he found out that the young
66,90,girl clinging to his arm was the heiress of the ays, would he not
17,56,refuse to perform the ceremony until they could be communicated with?
18,22,"I am Royal Ainsley," answered the young man, affecting not to hear the
1,25,last part of the question; and Ida, thinking she was called upon to
55,59,speak, responded, promptly:
57,12,"And I am Ida ay, sir."
78,79,The mayor wheeled about quickly.
0,69,"What! Did I hear you say the name ay? Are you the young girl stopping
77,8,at the Ocean House whom they call the niece of the ays?"
73,23,The girl was trembling so she could not answer.
59,73,"We might as well put a bold front on the matter," whispered Royal,
97,1,clasping quickly the ice-cold hands.
40,5,"She is, sir," he answered, with an air of assurance which he was far
73,84,from feeling.
56,91,The effect of his words upon his host was wonderful. An expression that
58,6,was almost diabolical flashed over his face.
25,69,"Hold!" he cried. "You need look no further for a minister; I will
76,55,perform the ceremony. It is a pity for the young lady to have to go out
89,13,in the storm to have a little service like that rendered. Old ay's
48,92,niece!" he muttered under his breath. "Ah, what a glorious revenge it
67,81,is for me to give her to this profligate! Of course, old ay don't know
34,74,anything about the escapade of this girl!"
28,41,He clinched his hands tightly together as he looked at her. There was
59,86,no feature of old John ay perceptible in this slender little creature;
74,65,but for all that, he hated her--ay, he hated her with a deadly hatred.
78,46,_He knew why._
83,28,"I will help you in this affair," he said, with a peculiar laugh that
6,94,might mean much or might mean little.
91,84,The ceremony was not a long one, and almost before Ida could realize
63,79,what was taking place, Royal Ainsley was bending over her, and calling
19,36,her his dear little wife. But there was something about the kiss that
65,41,he laid on her lips that made a strange shiver creep over her.
23,33,Royal Ainsley could hardly conceal his triumph. No matter if the ays
8,48,did find her now, they could not undo what had been done. He had wedded
36,45,her and her millions!
9,5,"Is there a train that leaves for New York?" he asked.
93,18,"Yes; one passes here in about twenty minutes from now. By cutting
62,77,across over to that side road you could easily catch it."
7,48,Half an hour later, they were steaming toward the city as fast as steam
65,11,could carry them. The dark curly head nestled against his shoulder,
11,36,while Royal looked out of the window, out into the blackness of the
94,90,night, little dreaming that he was on the eve of a terrible tragedy.
82,56,He had been lucky enough to secure the little compartment at the rear
38,94,of the drawing-room car, which those who have money enough to pay for
3,85,can secure exclusively for themselves.
94,92,"I ought to tell you something that is weighing very heavily upon my
79,1,mind, Royal," she said, nestling closer to her fair, handsome, boyish
92,87,husband.
33,24,"Not until to-morrow, love," he declared, drawing her toward him, and
60,36,kissing her fondly.
16,46,CHAPTER VI.
40,32,It was early the next morning when the Newport express steamed into the
40,92,Grand Central Depot.
100,73,Royal Ainsley cast a furtive glance around him as he stepped upon the
82,49,platform. He had quite expected a dozen or more detectives to spring
40,95,forward, for, of course, the telegraph wires had been busy during the
54,15,night.
84,91,They would no doubt be waiting to arrest him for abducting the heiress.
73,51,But when he had blandly informed them that lovely Ida ay was his wife,
23,76,what could they do but fall back abashed and disconcerted.
45,47,To his great surprise, he seemed to create no sensation whatever. No
25,43,one even noticed him as he joined the throng, with Ida ay clinging
61,8,tightly to his arm.
50,60,"I will give them some little trouble to find us," he thought to
100,10,himself.
16,67,He knew of a quiet, aristocratic family hotel facing the park, and
36,92,placing Ida in a carriage, he took a seat beside her, and directed the
1,97,driver to proceed as quickly as possible to the place indicated.
14,28,Whirling through the streets of gay New York was quite a sensation to
60,36,Ida, who had never been outside of her own country village, save for
70,12,that fateful trip to Newport.
69,97,With Royal clasping her two little fluttering hands in one of his
58,71,strong white ones, his left arm holding her close as the cab rattled
54,66,up Broadway, her fear of the noise, the great rush of people hurrying
99,9,hither and thither, and the great crush of vehicles that threatened to
30,3,demolish them every moment, gradually subsided as they rode along.
71,10,They reached their destination, and a moment more were ushered into the
80,6,little white-and-gold parlor.
2,70,"We will have the best breakfast that they can prepare," said Royal,
56,73,"and then I shall take you to see the sights of the city."
98,50,He was obliged to take the hotel clerk into his confidence.
20,21,"It's an elopement," he whispered in the clerk's ear. "y bride is the
25,56,heiress of the wealthy ays, of Boston. There may be a deuce of a row
45,2,when they trace us to this place, but it will end all right by the
97,53,fatted calf being killed for us. But as for the breakfast, how long
43,78,will it take to prepare it?"
71,56,"Not more than fifteen minutes," returned the clerk, with an obsequious
74,98,bow. "We will send up to the parlor, and let you know when it is
52,66,ready," he added.
38,96,He turned away with a royal air. Already he felt as if the ay millions
74,31,were in his pocket, that he was a man to be envied, that he was of
81,60,great importance.
48,14,Royal Ainsley immediately joined Ida in the parlor. He found her
14,56,ensconced in one of the large velvet easy-chairs, looking out of the
66,41,window, with something very like fright in her great dark eyes.
100,42,"Oh, Royal, are you sure it is quite right?" she sobbed. "Did you want
80,51,me to marry you so very much?"
38,77,"What a silly little girl you are!" he cried, impetuously. "Of course,
13,48,I want you. I could not live without you. I know you must be very
78,8,hungry, as well as tired from loss of sleep. Come over to this sofa and
29,69,sit down, and we will talk over our plans."
45,97,"Royal," she whispered, clasping his hands closer, "you would not
51,54,listen to me when I tried to tell you something in the conservatory;
82,34,but you must listen to me now. I can not be quite happy, dear, until
26,32,you know all. I--I have a confession to make."
59,37,He looked at her blankly.
70,10,"What odd words you use, my darling Ida!" he said. "A confession! I do
91,6,not like to hear you use such an expression. I hope that there is no
30,17,other lover in the background?"
41,73,"It is not a lover!" she cried, clinging to him. "I have never loved
26,74,any one else but you!"
23,81,"Then it is all right, my angel!" he cried, brightly, gathering her
56,51,closely to him, despite the fact that people were passing in the
17,62,corridor outside, and had a full view of all that was taking place
60,28,within the room. She struggled out of his arms, blushing like a peony,
56,75,even though she was his bride.
98,80,"Sit opposite me, where I can see you, and it will not be so hard to
51,66,tell you _all_," sobbed Ida, faintly.
55,15,He complied with her wishes.
27,82,"Cut the story as short as possible, dear," he said, "or you will be
17,37,obliged to have it continued in our next, as breakfast will soon be
49,45,ready."
65,77,"Oh, how shall I tell you the truth, Royal!" she said, distressedly.
98,25,"Perhaps you won't smile so when you know all, and--and--you might even
72,2,hate me."
70,27,"No matter what the little story is that you have to tell me, my
60,0,darling, I will love you better than ever."
69,98,"Oh, Royal, are you sure of it?" she cried, with that frightened look
52,25,which puzzled him so.
67,91,"Yes; I give you my word beforehand, that, no matter what you have to
54,37,tell me, I will love you all the more!"
95,48,"I will tell you all, then, and throw myself on your mercy to forgive
50,79,me for the past," she sobbed. "Hold my hands, Royal, closely in your
5,14,own, while I tell you all of the pitiful past, from beginning to end;
11,67,and then, Royal, you shall kiss my tears away, even--oh, Heaven, pity
5,20,me!--though I have sinned beyond pardon!"
59,62,CHAPTER VII.
2,9,Little dreaming of the purport of the story Ida had to tell, Royal
60,42,Ainsley drew near. For a moment, Ida ay's great somber eyes looked
8,77,into his as though she would read his very soul.
63,61,"Tell me over again that you will forgive me, no matter what it is that
63,26,I have to tell you."
2,48,"I have already given you that promise over and over again," he
79,85,declared. "Surely you don't want me to take an oath to that effect?"
35,45,"Not if your solemn promise is strong enough to bind you."
45,77,"You forget that you are wasting time, Ida?" he said, good-humoredly.
81,91,"It will not take me long to tell my sad little story," she answered,
0,1,with a half sob; "and oh, what a world of comfort it will be for me to
88,97,know that you will care for me, no matter what the world may think.
96,32,When you hear my story you will understand the great temptation, and
45,16,will not judge me too cruelly.
50,18,"To begin with, my mother and I lived with a very wealthy family in
23,15,Dorchester. y mother was housekeeper, and I--well, I had no regular
22,63,position there, until, owing to the meager salary they paid my mother,
87,92,I was compelled to learn telegraphy, and found a position at the
25,68,station. To gain my mother's consent to do this was extremely hard.
42,89,"'They will not be pleased, Ida,' she said, piteously.
45,8,"'What do the Deerings care for you or me?' I answered, bitterly. 'Only
10,57,to make you toil year in and year out for a pittance so meager that it
13,95,scarcely keeps body and soul together!'
0,62,"'But they allow me to keep you with me, my dear child. That is
50,45,everything to a mother who is poor,' she sighed.
24,85,"'I am not a child any longer,' I cried. 'I am quite sixteen. I must be
32,44,making money now, if ever, to help you!'
86,87,"'But what can you do?' she asked.
63,29,"When I told her my plans, she looked at me dubiously.
84,27,"'Surely rs. Deering would not object,' I declared.
96,56,"But she did object. To my surprise she flew into a terrible rage when
10,78,I summoned courage enough to go to the morning-room the next day and
90,1,asked to speak to her.
64,32,"I unfolded to the cold, proud woman my plans to make a living. She did
27,53,not wait to hear me through, but flew into such a passion of rage that
36,97,I drew back in terror.
43,1,"'I have different plans for you entirely, Ida ay,' she said. 'Go to
22,56,your mother. I told her my plans scarcely half an hour ago. She will
20,26,unfold them to you. ind, they must be carried out by you, or your
89,36,mother and you will suffer. Your father owed us a sum of money before
68,69,he died, and during the past years your mother has worked to pay us
99,100,off. Over one-half yet remains to be paid. Your mother's name is signed
47,34,to your father's notes of indebtedness, and she is responsible for
33,82,them. If I pressed for payment and she could not pay, she could be
48,57,thrown into a debtor's prison.'
22,66,"I sobbed aloud in my terror: 'Oh, rs. Deering, if this indeed be
31,6,true, there is more need than ever for me to earn money to pay off my
93,89,mother's debts.'
17,86,"'There is another way in which you can pay them off,' she answered.
42,89,"'Oh, how?' I cried, falling on my knees and clasping my hands.
9,51,"The answer came like a crash of thunder from a clear sky.
86,72,"'By marrying my nephew,' she said, harshly.
33,9,"I sprung to my feet in terror. arry any one! I, who was only a child!
46,30,"'y mother would not consent to anything like that, even----'
94,58,"'She will be forced to consent!' was the harsh reply. 'y nephew will
45,3,be here in a week.'
49,18,"I found my mother walking her room, wringing her hands and tearing her
56,40,hair. Her excitement was so great that for a moment I was terrified.
54,23,"'Has she told you all, Ida?' she asked, in terror.
0,64,"'Yes, mother,' I answered.
43,58,"'And did she tell you what this nephew of hers was like?'
28,52,"'No,' I replied, greatly puzzled by her manner.
3,57,"She shuddered as with a terrible chill.
65,81,"'Listen, Ida,' she said, in a strained, awful voice: 'Her nephew is
8,97,such a horrid creature, that to be hated he needs but to be seen. He is
60,71,a hunchback--and--an idiot--has a touch of insanity about him. Except
7,2,the first few years of his life, he has been confined in an asylum.
45,18,This nephew has a bachelor uncle, who has declared his intention
96,28,to make the young man his heir if he marries when he is twenty-one.
87,31,Otherwise the great fortune goes to another branch of the family. They
16,72,would make a victim of you, wreck your beautiful young life for their
82,16,own ambitious aims. It will be six months before he is of age. But the
9,43,marriage shall never be, my darling. Your young life shall never be
8,88,sacrificed by these inhuman Shylocks. When the hour comes, we will die
47,98,together.'
3,38,"One day my mother met me with a white, awful face.
87,62,"'rs. Deering's nephew has arrived with a valet!' she cried, under her
76,12,breath.
59,71,"'But the six months are not up, mother," I cried. 'It wants a
44,38,fortnight to that time.'
0,88,"'He has come to stay until you make your decision.'
17,79,"Oh, God! the horror of it! Death a thousand times over would have been
24,93,preferable to that.
98,21,"How could I stand at the altar and promise to obey a creature the very
79,77,sight of whom filled me with disgust and terror?
31,40,"I fled through the village, not daring to look behind me, and never
9,42,stopping until I reached the telegraph office.
60,35,"It was little wonder that I made strange mistakes during the hour that
100,8,followed.
77,19,"It was during this time that rs. ay stepped up to the window and
91,27,called for a blank.
97,66,"Although her name was the same as mine, yet we were in no way related
58,71,to each other. They were wealthy people from Boston, I had heard, and
45,0,were summering in the village.
86,16,"Without waiting to see the message sent, the lady hurried out of the
63,4,office. A great sigh broke from my lips as I noted the well-filled
29,37,purse that she carried, the magnificent diamonds she wore on her hands,
24,76,and which swung sparkling from her ears. Any one of the gems she wore
57,78,would have been a fortune to a poor girl like me.
100,5,"As she crossed the railway track in the direction of the post office,
33,99,she must have seen the train bearing down upon her from around the
54,72,curve of the road.
8,34,"However, she fainted away from fright, and lay directly on the track.
77,36,I had seen it all from my window, and I sprung to her rescue and
63,39,dragged her by main force from the track just in time to save her from
26,73,destruction, as the ponderous locomotive just then thundered by. rs.
69,52,ay's gratitude was great when she recovered consciousness.
48,28,"'How shall I ever reward you, my good girl?' she cried.
54,45,"'I need no reward,' I answered. 'I would have done that for any one!'
50,90,"'You must be rewarded,' she declared. 'y husband is coming from
20,77,Boston to-night, and he will insist upon doing handsomely by you.'
49,78,"I was living at home with my poor old mother, and when I went home
23,33,that evening and told her the story, she wept like a child.
4,90,"'You did a noble action, Ida,' she said; adding slowly: 'The ays
26,80,are very rich. I should not be surprised if they made you a handsome
15,86,present. I once knew a gentleman who gave a lad twenty-five dollars for
93,1,saving his son from drowning. Perhaps they may do as well by you.'
32,26,"You see, we were very poor--mother and I--and twenty-five dollars
67,0,seemed a great deal to us.
55,4,"'How much good we could do with that sum,' my mother said. 'We could
83,17,get a little ahead in our rent, and spare enough out of it to get a new
38,42,dress for you.'
37,24,"I clasped my hands. A new dress! Oh, surely it would be madness to
18,89,hope for such a thing!
40,94,"That evening rs. ay sent for me to come to the grand cottage where
91,97,she was stopping. Her husband, a very deaf old gentleman, sat at
53,49,the window as I entered. They both thanked me in the most eager and
85,1,grateful fashion.
47,91,"'We have been thinking the matter over,' said rs. ay, 'and I have
61,72,come to the conclusion that I will do something handsome for you--give
79,77,you a pleasure such as you have never experienced in your young life.'"
67,37,CHAPTER VIII.
91,46,"rs. ay paused and looked smilingly at me for a moment or two.
44,49,"'So great is the treat I have in store for you that you will never
75,92,forget it. But r. ay and I disagree slightly as to what it shall be.
8,47,We now lay the proposition before you. Which would you prefer--have
64,63,five hundred dollars in cash, or be taken to Newport for a season, have
95,84,lovely dresses, and stop at a great hotel, under _my_ protection, and
2,41,have as fine a time as any young girl at the sea-shore?'
43,24,"I cried aloud in the exuberance of my joy. I had read of the lives of
6,13,other young girls at the sea-shore, and this opportunity seemed like
52,92,the opening out of fairy-land to me. You will not blame me, Royal;
74,65,I was young and romantic. I had never seen anything of life or its
60,41,pleasures. A season at Newport! The very thought of it fairly took away
7,92,my breath.
86,100,"'Oh, I will go to Newport!' I cried. 'Then the great dream of my life
63,41,will be realized!'
1,20,"'y husband thought you would prefer the money, but I knew that you
12,54,would prefer the pleasure.'
23,38,"Half wild with joy, I went home and told my mother the wonderful news.
19,66,She shook her head sadly.
37,76,"'We are so poor, you should have chosen the money, Ida,' she sobbed.
64,11,'Such a great gift is offered you but once in a life-time!'
88,57,"'But what does rs. ay want you to do for her, Ida? Are you to be her
75,57,maid?'
59,43,"'Oh, no, mother!' I cried, with a hysterical laugh. 'I am to be a
39,24,real lady, wear fine clothes, and sit on the porch reading novels, or
41,38,promenade on the sea-shore, from the time I get up in the morning till
96,92,I retire at night. I shall have pin-money, too, they say, and that I
15,94,will send home to you. So everything will go on with you while I am
74,77,away as it did while I was here.'
69,29,"We had never been parted from each other, mother and I, and oh! it
80,88,wrung her heart to say 'Yes.'
1,81,"But after much pleading on my part she consented to let me go. She
92,34,made one proviso, however, and that was--I was not to fall in love with
21,77,any one whom I might meet.
99,86,"Oh, I can not tell you of my delight when I saw the wonderful dresses
82,19,that rs. ay purchased for me, saying that they were all my own
34,43,forever after. She took me to Newport with her. As my name was the same
62,11,as theirs, every one took it for granted that I was a niece of theirs,
90,91,instead of their _protégée_ for a few short weeks, a report which the
18,52,ays did not trouble themselves to contradict."
90,96,She had told her story hastily, impetuously, not daring to look into
78,54,her lover's face until she had concluded. Then she raised her great
33,13,dark eyes slowly. But what she saw in her husband's face made her cry
80,87,out in terror.
63,35,"Oh, Royal! Royal! what is the matter?" she cried, in alarm.
45,46,He sat before her as though he were petrified. The glassy, horrified
6,84,stare in his eyes cut to her heart like the thrust of a sword.
10,23,"I married you for love. You have helped me to escape rs. Deering's
23,47,dreaded nephew," she faltered.
43,49,By a wonderful effort he found his voice.
34,54,"Not the heiress of the ays!" he cried, hoarsely, as though he was
38,96,unable to realize the truth.
69,13,"You do not love me the less for what I have done, do you?" she cried,
63,94,catching her breath with a sharp sob.
62,80,Before he could find words to answer, breakfast was announced.
4,4,"Go in and eat your breakfast, Ida," he said. "I have some important
81,4,matters which I must attend to that will keep me busy for the next hour
34,20,to come. Don't wait for me. Lie down and rest until you hear from me.
14,92,You will need all your strength to meet that which is before you." And
97,72,his brows darkened ominously.
66,50,She was young, and youth has an appetite all its own. She was very
0,37,tired with all she had gone through the last few hours, and the
54,52,appetizing breakfast spread before her caused her to forget everything
29,70,else.
100,59,Like all young, healthy girls, she ate heartily; then she rose from the
80,42,table and re-entered the little parlor to wait for the coming of Royal
45,95,to ask him to send a telegram to her mother.
72,4,"Shall I show you to your room, miss?" asked the waiter.
72,1,"No," she answered. "I will wait here."
66,75,"Then here is a letter which has just been handed me to give to you."
94,12,She opened it, and found that it was from Royal.
58,42,For one moment Ida ay looked with an expression of puzzled wonder at
15,94,the letter which the hotel waiter had handed her.
49,56,It was in Royal's handwriting; she saw that at once.
78,71,What could he write to her about, when he had been away from her
39,63,scarcely an hour? He probably wished to remind her to be sure to be
94,76,ready when he arrived.
71,26,"How he loves me!" she murmured, a pink flush stealing into the dimpled
97,17,cheeks. "What a happy girl I ought to be that my lover loves me so
92,81,well!"
97,83,The waiter had gone back to attend to his duty. She saw that she was
44,87,alone, and with a quick action she raised the envelope to her lips with
31,28,her little white hands and kissed it--ay, kissed passionately the sword
55,13,which was to slay her the next moment.
58,97,Seating herself in a cozy arm-chair close by the open window, Ida
36,74,ay opened the letter which was to be her death-warrant, and read as
47,59,follows:
35,97, "IDA, I suppose the contents of this note will give you something of
97,86, a shock; but it is best to know the truth now than later on. I shall
14,96, come to the point at once, that you may not be kept in suspense.
50,8, "The truth is, Ida, that your confession has knocked all our little
44,58, plans on the head. To write plainly, when I thoughtlessly married
29,55, you, it was under the impression that you were the niece of the
25,26, ays--their future heiress. I have not told you much about myself in
76,35, the past, but I am obliged to do so now.
14,99, "I am not at all a rich fellow. I am working along as best I can,
44,89, living on what people call wits--and expectations, which make me a
16,28, veritable slave to the whims of a capricious old aunt and uncle.
22,10, "They have decided that I must marry a girl who has money. I would
52,82, not dare to present a portionless bride to them. In such a case, all
56,100, my future prospects would be ruined. I must add that I have a still
96,33, greater surprise for you. On leaving you, I purchased this morning's
64,68, paper, and the first item that met my eye was the absconding of the
90,63, man who performed the ceremony for us last night. It appears that he
50,12, was turned out of office some two days before, impeached, as it were,
35,87, for embezzling money.
86,8, "All power was taken from him to act in the capacity of mayor. Thus
56,38, the ceremony which we thought made us one is not binding. You are free
96,64, as air. No one will be any the wiser, and you are none the worse for
18,35, our little escapade--romance--call it what you will.
61,46, "A little affair in the life of a telegraph operator will not set the
42,76, heart of the great world throbbing with excitement. I am sorry affairs
55,79, have turned out this way; for, upon my word, I could have liked you.
34,82, There is but one thing to do under the circumstances; that is, to part
27,73, company. I advise you to go quietly back and marry the rich lover rs.
71,12, Deering has selected for you. That will be better than drudging your
34,11, life away in a telegraph office.
94,66, "This is all I have to say, and thus I take French leave of you.
45,65, Forget me as quickly as you can, little girl. I am nearly dead broke,
74,68, but I am generous enough to share what money I have with you. Inclosed
6,1, you will find a twenty-dollar bill--quite enough to take you back to
83,81, the village which you should never have left. Yours in great haste,
52,63,     "'ROYAL.'"
40,73,Once, twice, thrice--ay, a dozen times--the girl read the heartless
20,44,letter through until every word was scorched into her brain in letters
92,91,of fire, then it fluttered from her hands to the floor.
39,17,She sat quite still, like one petrified by a sudden awful horror; then
31,32,creeping to the window, she raised the sash, and, looking up into God's
88,16,face through the glinting sunshine, asked the angels in Heaven to
3,7,tell her if it was true that the husband she had but just wedded had
40,86,deserted her.
81,63,CHAPTER IX.
92,83,Again the poor child picked up the cruel letter; but she could not read
9,50,a line of it, though she sat looking at the written page.
46,8,"Not his wife!" she moaned over and over again, clutching her little
70,14,hands over her heart.
4,36,With a sudden frenzy she tore the letter into a thousand shreds, and
37,33,flung the pieces from her through the open window.
41,0,Would her poor, sick mother's heart break when she told her all? When
59,77,she went home, would they force her to marry the terrible being she
39,16,abhorred?
90,49,Home! Ah, God! what a mockery! She had only a shelter. If she refused
3,45,to marry the horrible hunchback, her mother and herself would not even
21,69,have that.
69,71,How could she face the future? The very thought of it made the blood
58,65,chill in her veins.
74,72,"Oh, Royal! Royal! death from your hands would have been easier than
31,12,that!" she moaned.
91,36,The next moment there was a heavy fall, and one of the house-maids,
1,71,passing the parlor, saw the girl lying in a heap.
96,2,They did all in their power to restore her to consciousness; but it
72,35,was quite useless. When they had worked an hour over her, they became
11,64,alarmed.
58,41,Where was her husband? Why did he not return? The hotel physician did
86,31,all in his power, but without avail.
100,13,"It looks like a case of brain fever," he said, "or perhaps typhoid.
40,38,Either is contagious, therefore dangerous. I should advise that she be
64,49,sent to the hospital around the corner."
53,42,"That husband of hers has not settled his bill!" exclaimed the
54,51,proprietor, his face darkening angrily.
1,29,"It is _my_ opinion," said the doctor, "that it is best not to await
7,50,the return of the young gentleman who accompanied her here. In short,
8,52,it is my opinion that he has deserted her."
98,49,In less time than it takes to tell it, poor, hapless Ida ay, the
12,12,victim of such a cruel misfortune, and a sadder fate yet to follow, was
6,85,taken to the hospital. The waning summer days drifted slowly by, and
63,46,autumn came with its dead, rustling leaves and sobbing winds, before
38,99,Ida ay opened her eyes to consciousness and turned them full upon the
68,26,white-capped nurse bending over her.
92,23,"Where is Royal?" she asked, faintly.
10,35,"You mean the young man who left you at the hotel?" queried the nurse,
91,68,who had heard the young girl's sad story; adding: "He never came back
56,2,to inquire for you. He has deserted you. He did not care whether or not
71,95,the shock would kill you. If there was ever a heartless scoundrel on
22,26,the face of the earth, he is that one!"
12,13,The lovely white young face never changed its pallor, the dark eyes
84,77,never left the grim countenance of the nurse.
73,3,"I want to leave this place at once," said the girl, attempting to rise
75,14,from her cot.
47,49,"No, no; you must not do so!" exclaimed the nurse. "It would be
51,80,dangerous in your case."
58,79,"But I want my mother," moaned Ida, piteously.
85,72,When the nurse made her rounds an hour later, to her great
36,95,consternation she found that Cot 27 was empty. The girl had flown! The
10,96,most diligent search through the city failed to elicit the slightest
63,96,trace of her whereabouts.
10,76,An hour later a little dark figure, ensconced in a corner of the car,
67,55,was whirling rapidly toward Dorchester.
42,70,She sat staring from the window with eyes that did not see so intent
41,98,was she with her own thoughts.
94,87,"I can not marry rs. Deering's nephew," she sobbed, under her breath.
33,54,"It would be easier for me to die. But what shall I do to raise the
89,99,money for which they hold my poor mother a veritable slave!"
93,98,She clasped her hands in piteous entreaty; but the soft, radiant moon
15,84,and the golden stars to which she raised her eyes so appealingly could
47,13,find no answer for her.
88,65,As the train slowed up at the station, she pulled her veil down
58,39,closely. She hurriedly alighted and sped like a storm-driven swallow
40,10,up the village street and along the high-road, until, almost out of
51,85,breath, she reached the Deerings' mansion. She stood transfixed for a
67,66,moment at the gate.
24,83,What was there about the place that caused such a shudder to creep over
82,77,her? What did the awful presentiment, as of coming evil, mean that took
75,50,possession of her body and soul?
63,86,CHAPTER X.
94,97,How weird the place looked, how gaunt and bare the great oak-trees
48,41,looked, looming up darkly against the moonlit sky! The dead leaves
83,76,rustled across her path as she crept around to the rear door.
85,39,She looked up at her mother's window, and another great chill crept
36,75,over her. All was dark there. It had always been her mother's custom
4,29,to place her lamp on the broad window-sill at night. any a time it
76,18,had been her beacon-light in cutting across lots from the station on
41,26,evenings when she had been detained by her work. How strange it was
40,82,that the light was not in the window to-night!
41,68,"other is not expecting me to-night," she said to herself, "that is
50,98,the reason it is not there."
84,56,But ah, how she missed it! How her heart had yearned to behold it, with
62,26,a yearning so great that it had been the most intense pain. She lifted
8,10,the latch and entered tremblingly, hesitatingly. It had been over two
25,78,months since her mother had heard from her. How had her patient,
46,62,suffering mother lived through it?
4,5,As she crossed the hall she heard the sound of rs. Deering's voice in
88,15,a sharp, high key. Perhaps the horrible nephew was with her. She paused
20,54,in a paroxysm of terror. She was talking to her husband, scolding him,
57,66,rather.
6,79,"It isn't _my_ fault that we lost the fortune," he was answering her
22,25,meekly. "You brought your nephew out of the asylum too soon. You knew
42,74,he would not be here a fortnight before he would do some terrible
23,93,deed--burn the house down over our heads, or kill himself when the
79,22,attendant was not watching, or some other horrible deed of that kind.
16,58,When he did succeed in mutilating himself before any of us was aware
34,80,of it, instead of sending him back to the asylum, to be cared for, you
1,50,kept him here under lock and key thinking to cure him yourself in a
73,21,couple of months or so."
15,9,"Ah!" thought Ida ay, leaning faint and dizzy against the wall, "now
40,57,I understand why rs. Deering consented to let me go away. Anything to
27,45,get me out of the house while she was curing the insane nephew whom she
14,89,had vowed I must wed."
78,89,The next words, while they shocked her inexpressively, lifted a world
51,32,of woe from her heart.
17,33,"Well, despite our watchfulness, he succeeded in killing himself at
27,79,last; so there's the end of it. The fortune is lost, and there's no use
0,32,in raving over it, and in venting your bitter wrath upon everything and
28,46,every one that comes within your range."
5,10,rs. Deering's anger was so great that she could not utter a word. She
78,18,flung open the door and dashed into the hall. The very first object
71,79,that met her gaze was the cowering little figure leaning against the
52,56,balustrade.
78,98,"You!" she cried, quite as soon as she could catch her breath. "How
8,33,dare you come here, Ida ay, you wicked girl! I am amazed that you have
58,83,the effrontery to face honest people after what you have done! We read
94,52,all about it in the newspapers--how you ran away from Newport with a
1,90,gay, dashing fellow who soon after deserted you. Don't attempt to tell
13,17,me anything about it. I won't listen to a word. Get out of this house
96,65,as quick as you can! Go, before I bid the servants throw you from the
18,41,house!"
20,44,"But my mother! Surely you will let me see my mother!" sobbed the
50,48,girl, piteously. "The whole wide world may be against me, but she will
79,7,believe me guiltless! _Please_ let me see her."
92,9,A laugh that was horrible to hear broke from rs. Deering's thin lips.
85,50,"Your mother!" she sneered; "much you cared about her, or how your
47,37,doings affected her. That article in the newspapers did the work, as
6,25,you might have known it would. I carried the paper to her myself, and
33,99,when she read it she fell to the floor with a bitter cry, and she never
1,25,spoke again. It was her death-warrant!"
62,22,For one moment the girl looked at the woman with frightened eyes, as
9,53,though she could not quite comprehend the full import of what the woman
35,0,was saying.
65,71,"It killed your mother!" she repeated pitilessly. "You might have known
80,18,it would. She died of a broken heart!"
75,80,A long, low moan came from the girl's lips. The awful despair in the
98,16,dark eyes would have touched any other heart, even though it were made
90,64,of stone; but in rs. Deering's heart there was neither pity nor mercy.
81,41,"Go!" she repeated, threateningly, "and do not dare to ever darken my
12,87,door again!"
71,83,"Will you tell me where you have buried my poor mother?" moaned Ida
38,66,ay, with bitter anguish.
90,76,"In the lot where the poor of the village are put," she answered,
68,18,unfeelingly. "We had to have a mark put over her. You can easily find
49,6,it. It's to the left-hand corner, the last one on the row. It would be
58,8,better for you, you shameless girl, if you were lying beside her rather
54,90,than sink to the lowest depths of the road you are traveling. Go--go at
77,4,once!"
53,60,With trembling feet she crept down the broad path and out of the gate.
13,51,She was drenched to the skin, and the chill October winds pierced
43,97,through her thin wet clothes like the sharp cut of a knife. It did not
36,6,matter much; nothing mattered for her any more. She was going to find
60,7,her mother's grave, kneel down beside it, lay her tired head on the
50,71,little green mound, and wait there for death to come to her, for surely
67,72,God would grant her prayer and in pity reach out His hand to her and
50,45,take her home. There would be a home _there_ where her mother was, even
62,46,if all other doors were closed to her.
45,53,She had little difficulty in finding the place--a small inclosure in
77,23,the rear of the old church that had fallen into decay and crumbling
29,80,ruins many years ago--and by the blinding flashes of lightning, she
21,94,found the grave of her mother--her poor, suffering mother, the only
24,47,being who had ever loved her in the great, cold, desolate earth.
89,34,"other," she sobbed, laying her face on the cold, wet leaves that
95,93,covered the mound, "mother, I have come to you to die. The world has
21,86,gone all wrong with me. I never meant to go wrong. I do not know how it
7,98,happened. Other young girls have married the lovers whom they thought
58,46,God had sent to them, and lived happy enough lives. I built such
96,45,glorious air-castles of the home I should have, the handsome, strong
38,64,young husband to love and to labor for me, and how you should live with
95,55,me, mother, never having to work any more. But oh, mother, all my plans
28,76,went wrong! I don't know why."
64,48,Ida ay crouched there among the sleeping dead, her brain in a whirl;
41,21,and the long night wore on. The storm subsided, the wind died away over
29,20,the tossing trees and the far-off hills, and the rain ceased. orning
68,28,broke faint and gray in the eastern sky, and the flecks of crimson
17,97,along the horizon presaged a bright and gladsome day.
94,30,The station-agent, hurrying along to his duties at that early hour,
97,44,was startled to see a dark figure lying among the graves. In a moment
72,54,he was bending over the prostrate form. He could not distinguish in
88,62,the dim light whose grave it was upon which the poor creature was
31,67,lying, but as he lifted the slender figure, and the faint, early light
52,83,fell upon the white, beautiful young face, he started back with an
39,21,exclamation of horror.
0,15,"Great God! it is little Ida ay!"
27,56,For an instant he was incapable of action, his surprise was so intense.
69,19,"Dead!" he muttered, cold drops of perspiration standing out like beads
21,94,on his perturbed brow. "Little Ida ay dead on her mother's grave!
57,82,God, how pitiful! She was so young to die!"
2,18,Then he knelt down beside her in the thick, wet grass, and placed his
85,20,hand over her heart in the wild hope that a spark of life might yet be
67,31,there.
46,32,CHAPTER XI.
46,53,With bated breath, Hugh Rowland, the station-agent, knelt down in the
13,20,dew-wet grass, and placed his hand over the girl's heart. Although the
23,57,sweet white face upturned to the gray morning light was as white as
66,98,death, he cried out sharply to himself: "Her heart still beats! God be
64,23,praised! There is life in her yet!"
18,75,Gathering her in his arms, as though she were a little child, he
39,19,carried her quickly across lots to the station, and placed her upon a
25,24,rude bench. Once there, he could control himself no longer. He dropped
63,18,upon his knees beside her, burying his face in the folds of her wet
73,81,dress, chafing her hands, and sobbing as though his heart would break.
87,47,He had loved the girl lying there so stark and motionless as he had
44,96,never loved anything in his life before; but he had never dared to tell
73,3,her of it. Though he was station-agent, and she a telegraph operator,
23,56,she seemed as far above him as the star is from the earth.
58,62,For a moment Hugh Rowland had almost lost control of himself; then he
50,36,remembered how horribly cold she was, and he had the presence of mind
11,69,to start a fire in the big stove that always stood in the center of the
26,33,waiting-room.
51,53,The grateful heat that rose from it quickly brought the breath of life
37,17,to the girl's white lips. The great, dark, somber eyes opened wide, and
36,85,she saw the rugged, kindly face of the young station-agent bending over
15,70,her.
60,12,"I found you--you had fainted in the graveyard," he said. "Luckily
63,76,enough, I was just passing, and I brought you here."
67,12,"Oh, why didn't you let me die?" moaned the girl, so bitterly that he
15,90,was shocked.
62,13,"It is very wicked to talk like that," he said, forcing down the great
35,10,lump that rose in his throat.
42,48,"No!" she cried, vehemently. "How could it be very wrong to leave a
35,8,great, cold, cruel world in which nobody wants you. I have nothing to
13,12,live for."
95,43,"But somebody does want you, Ida ay!" cried the great rough fellow,
25,0,with tears that were no disgrace to his manhood coursing down his
90,20,cheek. "I want you with all my heart!"
21,17,"Hush, hush, hush!" she cried; "you must not talk so to me!" she cried.
36,76,"Don't say any more! It can never be! You do not know all!"
25,47,"Do not say me nay. Give me the right to protect you, Ida. We can go
66,3,away from this village. I can get a job on the road anywhere along the
33,28,line. I will work for you, and tend to you so very carefully that you
5,39,will forget the past!"
88,100,She only turned away from him, pleading with him for the love of Heaven
52,100,to say no more. He stopped short, looking at her gloomily. He had used
30,82,all the words that he could command, and they had been of no avail. She
35,80,would not even listen.
91,49,"One moment more!" he cried, hoarsely. "Always remember, Ida ay, that
0,25,you leave behind you a heart that beats only for you--only for you. No
73,20,other woman's face shall ever win my love from you. I will wait here,
68,36,where you leave me, for long years, until you come back to me--ay, I
16,86,will wait from day to day with this one hope in my heart: Some day she
33,69,will come back to me; she will find the world too cold and hard, and
90,25,will come back to me to comfort her. I will watch for you from darkness
28,18,until day dawns again. y form, so straight now, may grow bent with
72,37,years, my hair grow white, and lines seam my face, but through it all I
90,87,shall watch for your coming until God rewards my vigilance. Good-bye,
31,12,and God bless you, Ida ay, oh love of my heart!"
78,45,She passed from his sight with those words ringing in her ears, and
23,72,when the New York express passed on again after she had boarded it,
87,47,the young station-agent fell prone upon his face to the floor, and lay
94,62,there like one dead.
17,88,CHAPTER XII.
74,30,Few passengers turned to look at the little figure that entered the car
42,80,at the way-side station at so early an hour of the morning, and Ida ay
47,78,cowered quickly down into the first seat. The clothes under the long,
24,23,dark cloak were saturated, but no one could see that, nor notice how
20,57,damp and matted were the curling rings of dark hair which the hood of
68,87,the cloak but half concealed. The hours crept on as the express whirled
5,21,over the rails; but Ida ay paid no heed to time.
15,0,But hunger at last began to tell upon her, and she eagerly hailed a
65,80,boy who passed through the train with a basket of sandwiches on his arm.
41,39,She looked at the coins she still held loosely in her hand, and found
35,64,to her dismay that, with the exception of two pieces of silver, she
37,95,held a handful of gold dollars.
42,93,"His pocket-pieces," she sobbed. "Oh, if I had known that, I would have
0,38,refused to take them; but--but I will work and earn money, and--and pay
75,32,him back double their value. Poor fellow--poor fellow!" and she laid
96,64,her face on the window-sill, sobbing as though her heart would break.
59,87,Suddenly she heard a voice in the seat back of her say:
87,54,"You seem very much distressed, poor girl. Is there any way in which I
95,3,can serve you?"
26,28,The deep, musical voice was so kind, so humane, so sympathetic, that
61,33,Ida ay turned around with a start to see who it was who had asked the
33,51,question.
25,57,She saw directly back of her a fair, handsome young man who had
20,27,evidently just entered the car, and who was depositing his grip-sack
56,33,and umbrella in the rack above his head.
98,12,At the first glance a faint shriek broke from her lips. She was just
24,50,about to cry out, "Royal Ainsley--great Heaven!--do we meet again?"
82,48,when she saw her error in time. Although bearing a certain resemblance
8,15,to the lover who had so cruelly betrayed her, a second glance told her
65,4,it was not him.
75,0,It was a moment ere she recovered herself sufficiently to answer, then
68,59,she faltered, piteously:
40,81,"I _am_ in sorrow, sir, so great that I do not think any young girl
2,94,but me could ever pass through it--and live."
96,83,"I do not wish to pry into your private affairs," said the young man,
67,64,courteously, "but I wish to repeat, if you will tell me what troubles
63,88,you, and I can be of service to you, I shall be only too pleased.
51,98,Although a stranger, you will find me worthy of your confidence, my
50,49,poor child!"
26,81,There was something about the handsome, kindly, blue-eyed young man
6,63,that caused Ida ay's heart to go out to him at once. His was a face
89,7,that women always trusted, and no one had ever had cause to regret it.
91,47,"I am going to New York in search of work," faltered the girl, clasping
27,91,her little hands closely together.
56,63,"That is certainly reason enough to weep," he replied earnestly. "ay I
94,59,ask if you have friends there to whom you are going until you can find
48,60,employment?"
19,34,Ida ay shook her head, her breast heaved, her white lips quivered,
76,78,while great tears welled up to the great dark eyes, so like purple
86,42,velvet pansies drowned in rain.
9,42,"I have no friends--no one. I am all alone in the world, sir," she
54,93,sobbed. "y mother is dead--dead. I have just left her grave. She and
81,83,I were all in all to each other; now she is gone, and I--Oh, only the
76,50,angels know that no sorrow is so bleak, so pitiful, so awful, as to be
0,34,all alone in the world."
46,45,"I can understand the situation perfectly," he answered in a low voice,
67,48,"and I can pity you. Although not quite alone in the world myself, I am
76,10,almost as badly off. But to return to yourself: I may be able to serve
30,15,you. What kind of employment were you intending to search for? In some
55,48,store, or dress-making or millinery establishment?" he queried.
76,77,She looked blankly up into his fair, handsome, earnest face.
77,63,"I do not know how to do anything of that kind," she answered, simply.
12,99,"I thought perhaps I might find employment in some telegraph office."
52,67,"Why, yes, indeed. I wonder that that idea did not occur to me before.
48,75,A friend of mine is superintendent of a large branch of the Western
28,73,Union, up Broadway. I will give you a note to him, and I have no doubt
44,15,he will do all in his power to aid you, providing he has a vacancy."
19,65,"Oh, thank you a thousand times, sir," cried Ida ay, thankfully; "I
100,39,shall be so grateful--oh, so very grateful!"
2,26,"ind, it is not a certainty, you know," admonished the stranger
57,70,earnestly; "I can only write the letter. But that is not assuring you
85,62,of a situation--we can only hope for it."
25,46,He tore out a leaf from his memorandum, and taking a gold pencil from
38,58,his vest pocket, hastily jotted down a few lines upon it.
43,79,"I am sorry I am not going through to New York; otherwise I would take
